### :sparkles: hi there!

I am a Software Engineering student at Instituto Infnet, specialized in JavaScript, Node.js, and React. Currently, I am applying these skills in an internship, contributing to web development projects and working with agile methodologies and team collaboration.

As a technology enthusiast, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. I have already accumulated valuable practical experiences, particularly in React and Node.js, while staying updated and adaptable to new trends and practices in the industry.
